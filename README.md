**üìù Description**

At **PedalTech Solutions**, a startup that develops data-driven
solutions for bike rental businesses, I undertook a project to analyze
key operational and revenue-related data for one of our clients, a
mid-sized bike rental shop. This project was part of my internship as a
**Database Analyst**.

The goal was to assist the shop owner, Emily, in making informed
decisions regarding inventory management, customer segmentation, and
revenue tracking, using SQL to extract valuable insights from their
dataset. This project showcases my ability to work with SQL to address
real-world business needs.

**üìä Project Objectives**

This project focuses on three major Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

**KPI 1: Inventory Management and Utilization**

-   **Objective**: Understand how effectively the shop\'s bikes are
    being utilized and how the inventory is distributed across
    categories.

-   **Questions Answered**:

    -   How many bikes does the shop own by category?

    -   How many bikes are available versus rented in each category?

-   **Outcome**: Provided insight into overstocked categories and
    opportunities for better inventory management.

**KPI 2: Revenue Generation from Rentals and Memberships**

-   **Objective**: Analyze the revenue generated by the shop through
    bike rentals and memberships, segmented by time and category.

-   **Questions Answered**:

    -   What is the total rental revenue by month, year, and all-time?

    -   What is the total revenue from memberships for each year and
        month?

    -   How did different types of bikes perform during a discount
        season (new vs. old pricing)?

-   **Outcome**: Helped Emily identify profitable months and optimize
    discount strategies.

**KPI 3: Customer Behavior and Segmentation**

-   **Objective**: Segment customers based on their rental history for
    targeted marketing.

-   **Questions Answered**:

    -   How many memberships have been purchased by each customer?

    -   How can we segment customers based on the number of rentals
        they've completed?

-   **Outcome**: Enabled Emily to design tailored marketing campaigns
    based on customer activity.
