Overview
At PedalTech Solutions, a startup focused on building data-driven solutions for bike rental businesses, I worked on analyzing business-critical data for a bike rental shop as part of my role as a Database Analyst Intern. The objective was to help our client, a mid-sized bike rental shop, gain insights into their operations, rental patterns, and revenue streams through SQL-driven analysis.

This project focuses on answering several important business questions posed by Emily, the bike rental shop's owner, and provides actionable insights that could shape her future business strategies.
